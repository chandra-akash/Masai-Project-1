### End Notes ðŸ“‘
In this project we were tried to achieve a near to perfect clone of the original website as much as possible with very limited knowledge of javascript & css. <br>
This entire journey of making the project was awesome. We learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave us a lot of confidence. Although we could have done more, time did not allow us to go further. But we must improve it.

### Limitations:
Not responsive yet and might not be properly visible on small screen devices
(Recomended Resolution: 1366 x 768 )
